# The-Tech-Demystify
Empowering community members to share their expertise by creating a creative and safe space where there is idea sharing, discussion, and face to face interaction with other participants

# Format

We want to introduce a community format, the so-called OpenSpace. It is a space where everyone can put his or her topics on the schedule. It's structured in sessions, each 30 minutes which are facilitated by mentors.

The topics YOU propose can vary from technical questions (e.g. a programming issue someone is struggling around with, how to select a proper framework or architecture, etc.) to problems you have in your daily business (e.g. how to deal when a client project is overtime or over budget, how to re-align the team, etc.) or community related topics like diversity and the inclusion of underrepresented groups in tech, how to organize a meetup or conference.

YOU can show something you are proud of, ask or discuss something that YOU like to know, even if you want to talk about something -  YOU are invited to suggest a session.

If you propose a session, don't worry, you don't need to prepare a talk or slides. Having your question or topic statement clear is just enough for the proposal!.

There will be no invited speakers. It's all about having fun with like-minded people in a safe environment where YOU create the program!


# Topic Submission 

Before the meeting day, everybody is invited to introduce their session on this GitHub repository. For submitting your contribution open a new issue at the developercirclesaccra/The-Tech-Demystify Github Repository. The idea is to give an introduction to your topic, tell the people about what they can expect.
